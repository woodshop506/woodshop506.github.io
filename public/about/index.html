  <p>I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with over 10 years of experience making web applications and sites on a variety of platforms and languages. Throughout that time, I have been a passionate advocate for leveraging current and emerging technologies to make a better experience for users and developers alike.</p>

  <p>I've found that keeping the UI and presentation layers in the browser and serving data through an API is the most promising architecture for both today and the future. Consequently, I spend the majority of my time developing for the frontend using a variety of frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Lo-Dash, Backbone, and Browserify (just to name a few).</p>

  <p>Given my preference for the frontend I tend to prefer light API wrappers around an ORM/datastore for the backend, but I've worked on projects in Rails, Django (&amp; Flask), Node/Express, and plain ol' PHP. I've even worked in VBScript prior to ASP.NET, but please don't make me do that again.</p>

  <p>I believe in and contribute to open source software, and I've released a number of packages both for Node.js and the browser. I like package management systems like Bower and npm, and tend to use a task runner like Grunt or Gulp to automate repetetive tasks.</p>  

  <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important technologies that we've invented, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.</p>
